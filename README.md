<h1 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kevin</h1>
<h3 align="left"> I started learning Swift and SwiftUI at the end of 2021/start of 2022 to change careers and become an iOS developer. I love the creative process of building an app and improving the user's productivity, experience, and daily tasks. I enjoy the critical thinking process when using Swift and the SwiftUI framework.</h3>
